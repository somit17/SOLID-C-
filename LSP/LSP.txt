Liskov Substitution Principle which is also known as LSP. 

Definition : Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming and it states that, in a computer program, if S is a Subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S 

1. Which means, Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types

2. More formally, the Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called (strong) behavioral subtyping

3. This Principle is introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 during her conference address on Data abstraction and hierarchy

4. This principle is just an extension of the Open Close Principle
